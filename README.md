# Kids Park <!-- change this to your website name -->

I built this website while working as a volunteer instructor in the Front-End Developer Fundamentals course.
<br>
The work was part of a volunteer group of young Syrians called "Syria Towards the Digital Revolution".
<br>
I designed the website myself for use during the course.
